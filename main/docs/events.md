# Events Specification

As specified in the architecture document, all micorserves communicate with each other through the following events.  Each event has the following metadata with which services may interact with.  Further specification can be viewed in `quantdome/event.py`

## MarketEvent

MarketEvents contain a dictionary of objects where each object corresponds to a ticker.

Here's an example:

```JSON
MarketEvent.data = {
    "AAPL": { ... },
    "GOOGL": { ... }
}
```

In each object will be the following information corresponding to the specified bar length:

```JSON
"APPl": {
    "timestamp": timestamp,
    "open": open,
    "high": high,
    "low": low,
    "close": close,
    "volume": volume,
}
```

## SingalEvent
Strategies will emit signal events by calling the following constructor.

```Python
signal = SignalEvent(symbol, price, quantity)
```

Where a positive (+) quantity corresponds to a buy signal and a negative (-) quantity corresponds to a sell signal.

Signal events will also have a timestamp which will by autogenerated based on instantiation.

## OrderEvent
Portfolios will convert signals into orders following appropriate logic.  They will call the following constructor.

```Python
order = OrderEvent(signal, price, quantity)
```

Order Events will also have a timestamp which will by autogenerated based on instantiation.

## FillEvent
Fill events will contain the following information.

```Python
FillEvent.timestamp
FillEvent.symbol
FillEvent.exchange
FillEvent.quantity
FillEvent.fill_cost
FillEvent.commission
```

Where again, a positive (+) quantity corresponds to a buy signal and a negative (-) quantity corresponds to a sell signal.
