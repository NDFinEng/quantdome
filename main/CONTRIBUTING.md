# Contributing Guidelines
This document outlines basic contributing guidelines for this repo

## Workflow
We will use a identification, planning, implementation style workflow for any repository updates.

### GitHub Issues
First any new features, bugixes, or refactors will be identified in GitHub Issues.  Anyone may open a new issue and is encouraged to do so.  In the issue please identify and describe:

1. The problem statement
2. The proposed solution
3. The implementation plan
4. Any necessary or helpful resources

After creation of the issue, team members are encouraged to review the proposed solution and plan and provide comments on the design desisions (if applicable).

### Feature Branch
Once an issue has been assigned, the developer should create a new branch for this issue.  All codebase additions and changes should be made in this branch.

### Pull Request
Once additions and changes are complete, the developer should open a pull request to merge the branch into `main`.  In the pull request please:

1. Identify the changes that were made
2. Provide a brief overview on the design decisions
3. Identify any outstanding issues or next steps.

After the pull request has been opened, the developer should request a reviewer.  The reviewer will go over all changes and additions, and either approve the pull request or comment on any issues.
